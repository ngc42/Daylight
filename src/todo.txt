Fix:
- Events outside the day time-range (22h 'till 04h next day for example) are not
  shown in day calendar view

Missing:
- exception dates (EXDATE)
- fixed dates (RDATE)
- test: WeekStart?
- test: DTSTART/DTEND with different TZ

UI:
- WeekStart?
- better error handling in import dialog
- Warn on appointment delete (Settings, Mainwindow) must get connected
