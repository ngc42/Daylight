Reading Events from File
========================
- stronger validation of user input (ical files)
- IANA-components missing. This is by intention.

Generating Events
=================
- EXDATE arrives in icalinterpreter but not in recurrence calculation.
- no events generated for an Alarm
- gen. DAILY-events is so slow
- DT-START, DT-END with different timezones

UI
===
- Alarm events (Edit tab f√ºr Alarms)
- WeekStart?
- better error handling in import dialog

TESTS
======
* UNTIL has no own TimeZone, its local, UTC or same like DTSTART.
* UNTIL is same type (Date/DateTime) like DTSTART
* TRIGGER can be Datetime or Duration

Documentation
==============
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545
- consistent naming
- doxygen comments?
